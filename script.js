//Page Navigation

//so this method ðŸ‘‡ of attaching event listener to every element is fine but if there are more elements then this is not efficient so here event delegations come into play
// document.querySelectorAll(".nav__link").forEach(function (eachElement) {
//   eachElement.addEventListener('click',function (event) {
//     event.preventDefault();

//     //if we want we could have written id = this.href here ðŸ‘‡but it would have given the whole absolute path but we just only want the section
//     const id = this.getAttribute('href');
//     console.log(id);

//     document.querySelector(id).scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
//   })
// })
/*So in event delegation, we use the fact that events bubble up. And we do that by putting the eventListener on a common parent of all the elements that we are interested in.  */
/* And so in our example, it's this container that's around all of these links, and that we saw in the previous video. So remember, that is this element here. So we will put our event handler on this element(nav bar) here, and then when a user clicks one of the links, the event is generated, and bubbles up, just as we saw in the last video. And then we can basically catch that event in this common parent element, and handle it there. Because we also know where the event actually originated. Right? So we can figure that out by looking at the events.target property. So that's what event delegation is, and so let's now go ahead and implement it.*/

//for event delegationðŸ‘‡
//1.Add the event listener to common parent element
//2.Determine what element originated the event

document.querySelector('.nav__links').addEventListener('click', function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();

  //so if we see in  console then we will find that if the click has happened on one of the links then the class will be 'nav__link' but if the click has happened on the container navbar then it will show 'nav__links'
  //so we just need to avoid 'nav__links'

  //Matching strategy
  if (e.target.classList.contains('nav__link')) {
    const id = e.target.getAttribute('href'); //e.target means the target element where the event has happened
    console.log(id);
    document.querySelector(id).scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
  }
});

//Tabbed Component

tabsContainer.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
  const clicked = e.target.closest('.operations__tab'); // we using closest method becoz what if the clicked button contains a child like span but we want only the button but as the button also contains span so we are using closest and here what happens if the button is only clicked then it will return the button but if the button's child span is clicked then also it returns the parent element that is button
  // console.log(clicked);
  //we are ignoring any clicks that happen to produce null
  //Guard clause -->in this case, when we have null which is a falsy value, then not falsy will become true and then the function will return and none of the code that's after it will be executed.
  if (!clicked) return;
  //the guard clause ðŸ‘† is a more modern  way
  //the traditional way would beðŸ‘‡
  // if (clicked) {
  //   clicked.classList.add('operations__tab--active');
  // }

  //Remove active classes
  tabs.forEach(t => t.classList.remove('operations__tab--active'));
  tabsContent.forEach(c => c.classList.remove('operations__content--active'));

  //Activate tab
  clicked.classList.add('operations__tab--active');

  //Activate content area
  document
    .querySelector(`.operations__content--${clicked.dataset.tab}`)
    .classList.add('operations__content--active');
  //so hereðŸ‘† as you can see the clicked.dataset.tab <- actually it means the data-tab which holds the value for each tabs i.e 1,2,3 or you can say that it is the html variable which we use in js to display the required content when the tab was clicked containing the value of variable'data-tab' that can be 1,2,3 iska matlab data-tab ek variable hai jiske madad se humlog content change kar sakte hai aur yahan data-tab ko select karne ke liye "data-tab" ko "dataset.tab" likna padega

//   //ðŸ‘† so there is opposite of mouseover and mouseenter and so opp of mouseover is mouseout and opp of mouseenter is mouseleave

//   //   logo.style.opacity = 0.5;
//   // }refactord this code aboveðŸ‘†

//   else nav.classList.remove('sticky');

//Sticky Navigation:Intersection Observor API<--this one is efficient
/*what actually is the intersection observer API, and why is it so helpful? Well, this API allows our code to basically observe changes to the way that a certain target element intersects another element, or the way it intersects the viewport. */
//to create an intersection observer API write const observer =  new IntersectionObserver() and pass in the params that will be one callback function and options so in options we will define the root of the viewport(matlab woh jagah i.e the target element which is intersecting but here we wrote null ) and then the threshold value matlab kitna percentage of the element dikhega toh callback function ko call karna so here we wrote threshold:0.1 i.e 10 percent so yaani like agar we wrote like thisðŸ‘‡

// const  observorCallback = function (entries,observor){
//   entries.forEach(entry => {
//     console.log(entry);
//   });
// };
// const observerOptions = {
//   root: null,
//   // threshold: 0.1 before we had set 10 percent now we will set multiple valuesðŸ‘‡
//   /*So you can use different threshold values, and maybe use different targets here, you can even use different roots, and so it would be a good idea to experiment a little bit more with this. Now what I'm gonna do here is to now specify an array, so to specify different thresholds, and one of them is gonna be zero, and the other one 0.2, so that's 20%. So 0% here means that basically our callback will trigger each time that the target element moves completely out of the view, and also as soon as it enters the view, okay? And so that's because the callback function will be called when the threshold is passed when moving into the view and when moving out of the view, and this is really important to remember here. */
//   threshold: [0,0.2]

// };

// const observer =  new IntersectionObserver(observorCallback,observerOptions );
// observer.observe(section1);
/*ðŸ‘†so yahan par kya ho rha ki jo humne define kiya that is observer (i.e intersection observer API ) usme humne pass kiya section 1 yaani ki jab bhi section 1 viewport yaani screen pe dikhega tabi intersection api kaam karega so ek tarah se intersection api ko observe karne bole hai yaani ki nazar rakhne bole hai section 1 par now look at options of observer i.e threshold which is 10 percent so yaani jab bhi section 1 ka 10 percent hissa(if you want to see the intersectionratio look at entry made by console.log) dikhega view port pe tabhi callback function call hoga

//   h1.removeEventListener('mouseenter', alertH1); //this makes it to only listen to the event once
//   //also we can remove the event listener any time i.e using setTimeout
// };
// //So, the mouseenter event here,is a little bit like the hover event in CSS.So, it fires whenever a mouse enters a certain element.
// h1.addEventListener('mouseenter', alertH1);

//instead of adding the eventListener we can use the on-event property directly on the elementðŸ‘‡
//these on-event property old schoolðŸ‘‡
// h1.onmouseenter= function (e) {
//   alert('addEventListener :Great you are reading the heading!');
// }
//lec 189 time:5:15
/*Now, there are two ways why addEventListener is better.
And that is that first one(addEventListener) is that it allows us to add
multiple event listeners to the same event.
So, we could do this here again
and simply change the function here.
But if we did the same with this(on-event property) property,
then the second function(i.e another function with same on-event property) would basically
simply override the first one(previous same on-event property).
So, that's one advantage of addEventListener.
And the second one even more important
is that we can actually remove an event handler
in case we don't need it anymore. */

//now if we want to remove the event listener we can just write
// h1.removeEventListener('mouseenter', alertH1); this should be written in alertH1 function

//we can also use html event listener inside html like <h1 onclick ="alert('HTML alert')"></h1>

//Bubbling and capturing lec 190
/*SummaryðŸ‘‡

Do I understand everything right?

1. User clicks target element. Capture phase starts.

2. Window captures event.

3. Event goes down, checking if any element on the way to the target has event handler and "making a note". (Not sure about this one).

4. Event reaches the target. Target phase starts.

5. Event listener in target catches the event and runs callback function attached to this target's event listener.

6. Now target phase is finished. Bubbling phase starts. Event goes (back) up.

7. Every event listener on its way is triggered and each runs its callback function until it reaches the window element (the main parent element in browser).

And all the event listeners have the element, which user clicked (the deepest one) as the target (e.taget) and element, to which we attached an event handler as the current target (e.currentTarget).

So all the elements on the way will have the same target - element which user clicked and different currentTargets. Also currentTarget is always === .this in event handler's callback function.*/

//rgb(255,255,255)
// const randomInt = (min, max) =>
//   Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);
// const randomColor = () => `rgb(${randomInt(0, 255)},${randomInt(0, 255)},${randomInt(0, 255)})`;
// // console.log(randomColor(0, 255));

// //phase 1 i.e.BUBBLING PHASEðŸ‘‡
// //from 6:09  lec191 you will know about this bubbling
// if you wanna read whats in lec 6:09 -> /*you see that the container also got its own random background color. So based on what we learned in the last video, why do you think this is happening? Well, just as we learned before the event actually happens at the document root and from there it then travels down to the target element. And so in this case, that is this link. And then from there, it bubbles up. And bubbling up means that basically it's as if the event had also happened in all of the parent elements. And so that is the reason why this exact event is now also being handled by this event listener here that is on nav_links, okay? So again, it is as if the click event here on this link had also happened right here in this element, so in the nav_links element, all right? So both of these handlers here are now handling the same event which happened here on this link. And as we keep clicking of course, the same keeps happening. Now, what do you think happens when we click only outside here? So only in the nav_links? Well, let's see. So you see that the color on the link itself keeps unchanged and that's because this is the parent element. And so from here, the event only bubbles up to its parent elements. */

// document.querySelector('.nav__link').addEventListener('click', function (e) {
//   this.style.backgroundColor = randomColor();
//   console.log('LINK', e.target, e.currentTarget);
//   console.log(e.currentTarget === this);

//   //we can also stop event propogation but in practice its not a good idea,also it can sometimes fix the problem in many complex problem
//   // e.stopPropagation();//here the parent element(i.e container,nav) will not change their color which means that the event never arrive at those elements, right. That's why they weren't handled there, and again, that is because we stopped the propagation right here.
// });
// /* the currentTarget is indeed,  the element on which the event handler is attached.  So, e.currentTarget  and here, e.currentTarget.  And so if we do this now,  then you will see that the currentTarget  is not the same.  Well, in the link it is of course,  because that's where the event happened  and it's also where the handler is attached to But then here it is, of course the nav_links. So, the container and here, the whole navigation element. And so you might have noticed that the currentTarget is exactly the same as the this keyword. So, the this keyword is also the one pointing to the element on which the EventListener is attached to   */

// document.querySelector('.nav__links').addEventListener('click', function (e) {
//   this.style.backgroundColor = randomColor();

  // console.log(e.currentTarget === this);
}, true); */ //setting here true(third parameter) means we are listening to capture phase now and not the bubble phase so it will when the event comes down from document root to this element
//our event handler here is only listening the bubbling phase(event propogation from child to parent) but not the capturing phase(i.e event happens in the document then it travels down to the target i.e the child element where the event has happend)--> this is the default behaviour -->this is becoz capture phase is not useful for us but the bubbling phase can be useful for event delegation
/*However, if we really do want to catch events during the capturing phase, we can define a third parameter in the addEventlistener function. For example here, we can set the third parameter to true or false. And so let's set it to true. And so in this case where this used capture parameter is set to true, the event handler will no longer listen to bubbling events, but instead, to capturing events. */

// //and for that we have the closest method

// /*So let's say that on the page, we had multiple headers so multiple elements with a class of header, but for some reason we only wanted to find the one that is a parent element of h1.

/*Now to close off this section,
let's take a quick look at a couple of different events
that occur in the DOM during a webpage's life cycle.
And when we say lifecycle, we mean right from the moment
that the page is first accessed, until the user leaves it.
And let's do that right here at the end of this file.
Now, the first event that we need to talk about is called DOM content loaded.
And this event is fired by the document
as soon as the HTML is completely parsed, which means that the HTML has been downloaded
and been converted to the DOM tree.
Also, all scripts must be downloaded and executed before the DOM content loaded event can happen.
And of course we can listen to that event,
and since it happens on the document, we call the add event listener method on the document.
And then name of the event is, as I mentioned,
DOM content loaded.ðŸ‘‡ */
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function (e) {
  /*All right,now this event does actually not wait for images and other
external resources to load.Okay. So just HTML and JavaScript need to be loaded.
So let's now take a look at this event or basically justlog something to the console.
So HTML, parsed and DOM treebuilt, and we can also take a look at the event. ðŸ‘‡*/
  console.log('HTML parsed and DOM tree built', e);

}); 
/*So this hereðŸ‘† means we can now execute code that should only be
executed after the DOM is available.
And in fact,we want all our code only to be executed after the DOM is ready.
Right? So does that mean that we should wrap our entire code into
an event listener like this? So with a function like this, well, actually, no,
we don't need to do that.
And that's because we have to script tag,
which is the one that imports or a JavaScript into the HTML,
right. At the end of the body. */

/*Now there are also other ways of loading the JavaScript file
with the script tag,but we're going to talk about that in the next lecture.
Now, right now, if you're coming to vanilla,
JavaScript from jQuery,then you're probably used to wrap all your code into a
document ready function, which in JavaScript,or actually in jQuery, it looks something like this.
And so this is equivalent to the DOM content loaded in
vanilla JavaScript.
Okay.
But again, no such thing is necessary in regular JavaScript.
Okay. */

//Load event listenerðŸ‘‡
/*Anyway,next up there is also the load event and the load event is
fired by the window. As soon as not only the HTML is parsed,
but also all the images and external resources like CSSfiles are also loaded.
So basically when the complete page has finished loading is
when this event gets fired.
So as always, we can also then listen to that.ðŸ‘‡*/
window.addEventListener('load', function (e) {
  // So load.,function,
  // and then here we can log.
  // Page fully loaded along with the event. ðŸ‘‡
  console.log('Page fully loaded', e);
});

//Unload event or before quittingðŸ‘‡
/*Now, finally,
the last event that I want to show you is the before unload
event, which also gets fired on window.
So window.add event listener.
And so that's before unload.
And this event here is created immediately before a user is
about to leave a page. So for example,
after clicking this close button here in the browser tab,
so we can basically use this event to ask users if they are
100% sure that they want to leave the page. */

// // Now in some browsers to make this work,we need to call prevent default here. In Chrome
// // it's not necessary, but some browsers require it.ðŸ‘‡

// console.log(e);
//   /*And actually in order to display a leaving confirmation,we need to set the return value on the event to an empty
//  string. ðŸ‘‡*/
//   e.returnValue = '';
//   /*And so now we get this pop up(when we try to leave the page in the chrome browser) here, indeed, which asks us "if we want to leave the site". Now a long time ago, developers were actually able to customize the message(that is if we want to leave where it says changes may not be saved) that was displayed here, but then of course, many people started to abuse this. And so now we can only see it as a generic message. So no matter what we write here(that is the e.returnValue = 'anything'), we will always get this same pop-up('changes may not be saved one's ').
